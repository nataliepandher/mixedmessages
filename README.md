### codecademy javascript syntax project made by Natalie Pandher on 7/4/21

#### this code generates a silly weather forecast, clothing suggestion, and activity suggesting after calling the function with the user's name

#### it took about an hour to make this project. i would love to make this into an interactive site with html and css so user's and write in their name and then click a button to generate the message. it would be cool to add pictures and videos correlating to the message as well.
